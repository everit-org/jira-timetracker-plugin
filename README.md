jira-timetracker-plugin
=======================

Sharing values is part of our culture, so it was obvious that we would share Timetracker with JIRA users on github and the Atlassian Marketplace. Timetracker is now installed in more than 2000 systems. We would like to thank you - this superb community - for sending us so many feedback, opinions, development suggestions and critical remarks.

To keep serving your requests in a professional way, from version 3.5.0, the Timetracker for JIRA Add-on will be released as a Paid-via-Atlassian Add-on. 
It's important to know, that the free versions (up to 2.8.4 and 3.4.4) and this repository will remain available, but we will stop supporting them. Furthermore, the source code will no longer be managed here in the future.

Check out the Timetracker's page on the [Marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/org.everit.jira.timetracker.plugin/server/overview) to see more information about the pricing and what you get in the new paid version.
If you have any questions/suggestions about Timetracker, feel free to contact us at support.ejs@everit.biz or info@everit.biz.
